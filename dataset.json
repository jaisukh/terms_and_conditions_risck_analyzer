{"plain_text":"x Terms of Use   Roblox Privacy and Cookie Policy   Developer Exchange Terms of Use   Roblox Community Rules   Roblox Name and Logo - Community Usage Guidelines   Roblox Community Rules  Roblox Community Rules  The following Community Rules apply to all Roblox users, and are part of the Terms of Use. These Rules are made up of two sections. All Roblox users and those participating in Roblox events (online or offline) must follow Section I. Developers must follow Section I and the additional rules in Section II.  Section I. Basic Rules \u2013 Applicable to all Users (players, developers, and everyone else) and to anyone participating in a Roblox related event (online or real life). Roblox helps power the imagination of our users. Those users are of all ages and come from around the world to create adventures, play games, roleplay and socialize. \u00a0We strive to create a community that balances the needs, safety and interests of this truly diverse user base. To help achieve this goal, we put together these Rules, which apply to whatever you do on Roblox (whether playing, chatting, sending messages, posting comments, creating or publishing content, dressing up your avatar, and anything else in the games or on the platform).\u00a0These Rules also apply to anything that you participate in the real world or online related to Roblox, such as the Roblox Developer Conference (\"RDC\"), Roblox developer chat channels and other online or offline events and gatherings hosted by or related to Roblox. Please remember to periodically review these Rules, as they will be updated from time to time. As good members of the community, you should report all violations by using our Report Abuse\u00a0system, which is located throughout the site and in-game.   Guiding Principles   Be friendly, patient, and welcoming. Support a safe environment and help us to ensure that everyone follows these Rules.  Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It\u2019s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.  Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren\u2019t acceptable.  Try to understand why we disagree. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we\u2019re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re wrong. Don\u2019t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. Let's focus on working together to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.  These are the rules of conduct that everyone on Roblox must follow. Below are some specific examples. But, these are much broader than the examples below and you should stick to these Rules if you are uncertain as to whether any particular action is allowed.   Personal information. We strongly encourage you to protect your personal information. In some cases (such as when you are under 13), we employ automated tools and other techniques so as to help comply with legal requirements concerning your personal information. In all cases, you are not allowed to share personal information of others, including through any comment or message posted on Group walls, private or public chats, forums or personal posts. Personal information includes:  Full name; Email; Password; Home or other address; Telephone number; Social security, passport, or national identity number; Real life, personal, or family photos (these are not permitted to be uploaded for community safety). and Other personally identifiable information.    Harassment and cyberbullying. We do not tolerate this. Examples include comments or actions meant to:  Stalk, bully, intimidate, hurt, attack, abuse or humiliate someone (or something that a person may care about). \u00a0This includes using or encouraging the use of profanity (swearing); Reveal someone\u2019s personal information; Sexualize someone or something, which would include sexual harassment and sexual bullying in any form; Harass or single out anyone (or something that a person cares about) for ridicule, abuse, malicious attack, or anything similar to that; Call out bad behavior of others publicly. You should use our reporting tools on the site to let us know of any bad behavior. and Incite others to do anything listed above.    Child endangerment. We have users of all ages and we want to create safe environment for all of them, including children. So, we do not allow any actions that could put children in inappropriate or dangerous situations, including:  Grooming and other predatory behavior; Anything that sexualizes children. and Any other actions or comments that are listed in these Rules that are directed to or are about children.    Hate speech or actions. You are not allowed to engage in discriminatory speech or actions, based on any of the following:  Race or ethnic origin; National origin; Religion or religious affiliation; Disability or disease; Gender, gender identity or sexual orientation; Age. or Veteran status.  The example content below is not permitted on Roblox. The list below provides some examples but is not exhaustive. Roblox Safety Moderation team will block inappropriate content within these rules.  Clothing with red arm bands; Confederate flags. and Ugandan Knuckles memes.    Impersonation and defamation. We all treasure our identities and we don't want to be defamed. You are not allowed to impersonate another person\u2019s identity, defame someone or commit libel. This would include impersonating another player, celebrity, a Roblox employee, the police, government official or anyone else. So, do not use any of the following that is associated with someone else in order to pass yourself off as that person.  Name or username; Position in a company; Digital representation; A post or comment. and Personal information.    Threats and self-harm. In the digital environment, it is hard to tell what is a joke or is serious. So, we take all threats seriously and do not allow any threats on Roblox. We also take reports of self-harm very seriously. We are in active communication with police departments across the globe and often report threats\u00a0related to physical harm or public safety.  Looking for dates or dating partners. As a social platform for play, Roblox tries to provide a safe place to meet on-line friends, play, chat, and collaborate on creative projects. However, this is not the place to look for dating partners.  Sexual content or overly violent content. We do not allow such content, including:  Sexual content or acts, sexual violence, exploitation of any kind, or excessive violence. This includes such content whether or not nudity is involved and whether or not it would rise to level of being pornographic or being explicit; Content that implies or makes an avatar appear naked or in underwear\/undergarments. and Atrocities, massacres, and other shocking real (or pseudo-real) world events.

We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.  Other activities. We remind you of the Rules listed above. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Here are a couple of other items to keep in mind:  You may offer promo codes only for in-game items, content or currency in your games. Promo codes cannot promise Robux or digital goods that are not part of the game. Promo codes must be clearly labeled for your in-game content only and should not appear to be official Roblox offers or offer official Roblox items or Robux. As discussed in Roblox Terms of Use, you cannot (and you cannot allow others) sell, trade or give away Robux, digital goods or game codes except through official channels on Roblox platform. For example, you\u00a0cannot\u00a0conduct such transactions through chat, Roblox Groups, or third-party apps or websites.\u00a0You also cannot buy or sell Roblox games or Groups. Third parties sell or provide Game eCards (which are physical cards or digital items that provide a code that you can use to redeem Robux or other virtual items on Roblox). Those Game eCards have their own terms and conditions associated with them. If you want to sell, give away or do anything else with those eCards outside of Roblox (on an external website or social media channel), then we take no position as to those actions. However, we recommend you check the T&amp;Cs of the eCard and place you want to do the action to see if that is allowed. Certain trades are allowed through Roblox. (Found by clicking on \"Trade\" on the toolbar). No other method of trading is permitted on or off Roblox. Exploiting is not permitted in Roblox. This includes inappropriately obtaining and uploading \"stolen\" game content. Roblox moderators will determine exploited game content at their discretion with the tools available to them and may immediately terminate accounts caught participating in this behavior. Offsite website links, services, and additional 3rd party content are not permitted on Roblox with the following exceptions: YouTube, Twitter, Twitch. Users under the age of 13 are not permitted to share YouTube, Twitter, Twitch links for their privacy and safety. Permitted offsite links, content, or references must contain Roblox appropriate content or your account will be moderated up to immediate termination. Using partial links, filter-breaking, using permitted website links to indirectly link to non-permitted sites, content, or services, describing or otherwise encouraging users to go to unpermitted offsite links, content, or services is also not allowed. Roblox Terms of Use\u00a0have many terms and conditions that you must follow to use Roblox. Please make sure you read those Terms.    Consequences and Violations. The type and degree of action that we take for violations (i.e., a violation of Roblox Terms of Use and other terms that are part of those General Terms, including these Rules) is judged on a case-by-case basis (in our sole discretion). We weigh the type of violation, whether you are repeat offender and other factors. You should understand the following:  Certain minor violations will result in a warning or temporary ban. More serious violations will result in a permanent ban. If your violation is a serious one, we may not allow you to participate in our DevEx program and you may lose all rights to any Robux, virtual goods, or other items that you may have earned, purchased or otherwise acquired or Provided (as that term is defined in the Roblox Terms of Use) to us. We actively work with law enforcement agencies throughout the world, and regularly report illegal activity, threats to others, threats of self-harm and other relevant items to them. If you have multiple accounts, we reserve the right to take action against all of your accounts for any single or multiple violations. The account holder is responsible for all violations that occur on that person\u2019s account. So, never give your password to anyone else (except if you are a minor, to your legal guardian). Do not discuss publicly any actions that we have taken against you or anyone else for a violation. If you have questions about any action that we have taken against your account for a violation, you can contact us at appeals@roblox.com. If you violate these Rules when participating in a life event organized by, or on behalf of Roblox, you may be sanctioned, or expelled from the event, at the discretion of the event organizers.     Section II. Additional Rules for Developers. To be clear, Developers must follow all the \"Basic Rules\" listed above. As a community, we strive to make Roblox a safe and enjoyable place for everyone and appreciate your efforts in helping us build this positive environment. These Community Rules for Developers outline the acceptable and appropriate ways to build and publish games on Roblox. If you have any questions about how to interpret these Rules and how they might apply to your particular case, please send them to info@roblox.com. If you know of anyone or any game that is violating these Rules, please\u00a0report all violations by using our Report Abuse\u00a0system, which is located throughout the site and in-game. \u00a0Please remember to periodically review these Rules, as they will be updated from time to time. Any attempt to violate or go around these Rules will result in the game being suspended or completely removed. the user account or Group associated with the game may also be deleted. \u00a0Roblox does hear appeals for moderation consequences on a case by case basis, but reserves the right to act on the matter in the way that it deems appropriate. If you would like to request an appeal, email appeals@roblox.com.   Building your game. When building your game, it\u2019s important to do the following:   Filter all chat and text. Developers must pass all chat and\/or game text through Roblox\u2019s filtering system. Roblox scans all chat communication and player inputted text for the safety of our users and legal compliance reasons,\u00a0including\u00a0the\u00a0Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). All chat and content must also be reportable through the Report Abuse system.  Keep your game description up-to-date.  Enable users of your game to contact you\u00a0so you can support your game.  Don\u2019t build a game that encourages (or redirects) users to go off Roblox.  Do not ask for or collect (or allow the transfer between players in your game) any personally identifiable information (PII).\u00a0For example, you should not ask for a player\u2019s first and last name, age, home or physical address, something that contains a person\u2019s image or voice (such as a photograph, video or audio file), social security number, passport number (or national identity number), phone number or email address (or other forms of online contact information).  Do not implement any gambling or casino style games that involve real money in any way. This includes Robux, as Robux can be purchased for real money. Games should also be fair and not be skewed in the developer's favor.  Do not create promotions offering prizes of any sort (including contests, raffles, lotteries, chain letters or any kind of giveaway). It is okay to offer players promo codes for in-game items only so long as they are not in exchange for something (e.g., in exchange for a thumb up on your game).  Do not sell, trade or give away Roblox currency, digital goods or game codes outside of the channels provided to the users on the Roblox site.\u00a0Third parties sell or provide eCards (which are physical cards or digital items that provide a code that you can use to redeem Robux or other virtual items on the Services). Those Game eCards have their own terms and conditions associated with them. If you want to sell, give away or do anything else with those eCards\u00a0outside of Roblox\u00a0(on an external website or social media channel), then we take no position as to those actions. However, we recommend you check with the terms of those eCards and place you want to take the actions.  Assist with rolling out technical features and updates, which may be for security, stability, legal or other reasons, and may include updating your game or other content.  Do not upload, Publish, or otherwise Provide games or any other User Generated Creations (\"UGC\") that have previously been moderated or suspended from access on Roblox, whether that content was created by you or someone else. Developers must ensure that their games and all content within their games abide by the rules. Developers who are terminated or banned from Roblox may not transfer their creations or allow others to create derivative works from them. The terms \"Publish,\" \"Provide,\" and \"UGC\" as used here have the same definitions as those described in the Roblox Terms of Use.  Do not copy, transfer, display, or otherwise use the UGC of other users outside of Roblox, including on other gaming platforms or on physical mediums, such as clothing.    Creating positive game experiences. When designing your game, focus on providing positive game experiences for our community (e.g., working in a pizza restaurant, building a theme park, etc.). You should encourage the proper use of your game and never directly or indirectly encourage inappropriate behavior. For example, experiences within a game should not have an inappropriate theme (sleepover\/slumber parties), contain nude or partially clothed characters, or display suggestive animations. Below is a list of inappropriate behaviors (and please note this list is not comprehensive. you should think through if you are providing or promoting inappropriate behavior):  Providing users\u2019 personal information; Harassment or bullying; Using or encouraging the use of profanity (swearing); Child endangerment; Hate speech or actions; Impersonation and defamation; Threats and self-harm; Looking for dates or dating partners; Sexual content or overly violent content; Dangerous, unethical and illegal activities. or Content that implies or makes an avatar appear naked or in underwear\/undergarments. This includes solid color avatars without clothing.    Using appropriate content. Inappropriate content is not allowed within Roblox games.\u00a0Do not create or upload any images, videos, audio files or other content (including animations or scripting), discuss topics or use language that falls in the bulleted list above. Do not upload or use content or materials that you do not own or have permission from the owner to use. If we are notified that your uploaded content violates another\u2019s intellectual property rights, we will block or remove that content without notice and follow the process set out in Roblox Terms of Use. Roblox\u00a0actively monitors game content and text.\u00a0Some violations are blocked automatically through the use of filters and other detection systems. And we moderate and take other actions regarding content when flagged by our community.  Any consequences applied to violators are at the sole discretion of Roblox and may range in severity from a warning to account deletion; Violations are dealt with in a manner that reflects the severity of the violation and the threat to the Roblox community. Important additional information on inappropriate content:  All text in uploaded images must be clearly visible to Roblox moderators. Images with tiny, unclear, or unreadable text will be blocked from upload. Pills, syringes, or other content representing drug paraphernalia or drug use are not permitted. Alcohol, alcoholic references, drunkenness, smoking cigarettes, cigars, and vaping are not permitted. Distorted audio, including excessively slowing down or speeding up the audio content to make it indiscernible, and audio that is excessively loud including screaming, high-pitched or excessive noises are not permitted. Dating is not permitted on Roblox. This includes content that explicitly or implicitly promotes, encourages, or references dating. \"Clickbait\" advertisements are not permitted. Advertisements such as \"Click this 1000 times\", \"Click to pick your Dominus\" or ones that offer free Robux, Roblox virtual items, etc. or that otherwise falsely represent the content being advertised and solely exist to encourage a user to click on the ad to inflate ad clicks are not permitted.      Reporting Issues. If you see another user or content on our site or in a game, please use the Report Abuse feature to file a report within our moderation systems. You can find the Report Abuse option within any game, chat or content on Roblox. Roblox employs both moderation technology systems and a team of moderators to pre-review content and reports of violations of our Community Rules and Terms of Use.

{"plain_text":"What are your thoughts on internet privacy? Big internet companies like Facebook or Google have effectively hijacked the privacy discourse in the recent years. Their marketers managed to convince the public that the most important things about privacy are superficial tools that allow hiding your public posts from the people around you. Adding these superficial tools enables companies to calm down the public and change nothing in how they are turning over private data to marketers and other third parties. At Telegram we think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be instead:  Protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc. Protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc.  This is what everybody should care about, and these are some of our top priorities. We don\u2019t use your data for ad targeting, we don\u2019t sell it to others i> Q: A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright. What do I do? All Telegram chats and group chats are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. But sticker sets, channels, and bots on Telegram are publicly available. If you see a bot, channel, or sticker set that is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org. Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner\u2019s behalf.  Q: Wait! 0_o Do you process take-down requests from third parties? Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots. User-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers are not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a complaint at abuse@telegram.org or dmca@telegram.org regarding the legality of public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate. Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders' principles. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Server-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats) Go to Telegram Settings &gt. Privacy and Security and turn on Two-Step Verification. This way the phone number alone will not be enough to log in to your account. Bots are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API and platform.

Here's how: Information across Facebook Products and devices: We connect information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them.

For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public, or a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram to communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can see the content you send. You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with.

{"plain_text":"The following document fulfills the requirements of the GDPR Articles 13 and 14, and informs you about the collection and processing of personal data within our project.  All data is stored in a German datacenter, and therefore the data is subject to German law as well as EU law.  We do not collect any personal data of visitors of the NewPipe website. We do not install cookies on your system, and we do not track our users.  Personal data such as the IP address are only processed for the purpose of serving the pages by our webserver software, and are deleted from the memory immediately after the page has been sent to the user. Server logs To have a minimum of control in scenarios where our website is abused, for example denial-of-service attacks, we configured our webserver to create a so-called acces log. This log file contains a list of all requests made to this server, each request in a separate line. The logged lines contain the following information:  the IP address that was used to make the request a timestamp the URL the HTTP status code the user agent the user\u2018s browser sends automatically  We need to keep logs of the IP addresses sending requests to our server. As IP addresses are considered personal data and we respect the privacy of our users, we only keep enough of the IP address to be able to able to react to abuse (e.g., DoS and other attacks). Personal data such as the IP address are only processed for the purpose of serving the pages by our webserver software, and are deleted from the memory immediately after the page has been sent to the user. We calculate prefixes of the IP addresses to anonymize them as follows:  For IPv4 addresses, we remove the last two bytes to anonymize them. For example, an IP address such as 12.34.56.78 would be logged as 12.34.0.0. For IPv6 addresses, we remove all bytes but the first two. For example, an IP address such as 2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7344 would be logged as 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:0 (short 2001:0db8::).   Users have the ability to leave comments themselves. We use the excellent isso software to provide this feature. If a user sends a comment, the following data is collected:  mandatory data:  a name (can, but does not have to be a user's real name), allowing users to let others (including the NewPipe project) identify them, for example on other services, such as GitHub.   Data collection and processing by Sentry, our bug report tracking system We maintain an instance of Sentry, a bug tracking and aggregation system, in order to process user-provided bug reports including crash logs and messages. Due to the amount of bug reports we receive every day (varies from a few hundred to a few thousand e-mails every week), we can not check every report for personal data by hand. We ask you to ensure you don't send us any personal data you don't want to share with us.  Every user has the right to request the correction or completion (GDPR Art. 16) or deletion (GDPR Art. 17) or restriction of use (GDPR Art. 18) of the data sent to us at any time.  In many cases, due to our philosophy, the data is highly anonymized. If your data is, and we think it should be, anonymized so that we cannot associate with any user, we can most likely not delete it from our system. In these cases, however, no personal data is collected. In many cases, due to our philosophy, the data is highly anonymized.  According to GDPR Art. 77, you may, at any time, file a complaint about our data processing at your local data protection officer.

{"plain_text":"Arch is a community of volunteers. Rather than providing a complicated pattern of balanced freedoms and restrictions, as well as the time, resources and personnel required to interpret and administer such rules, we have chosen a simple principle to embrace for the benefit of all. Therefore, this entire document may be condensed into one simple admonition:   Proactively seek to give of yourself and to bring only benefit to your peers and community. Arch Linux is a respectful, inclusive community. Anti-social or offensive behaviour will not be tolerated. Having multiple accounts is an unnecessary use of resources. Further, it may be interpreted as trolling behaviour. Criminal solicitation is forbidden in this community. In this context, \"criminal solicitation\" shall mean, \"To actively or implicitly facilitate, incite, move, or persuade others to some act of lawlessness or illegal activity.\" Therefore do not post discussions which demonstrate, or link to, criminal solicitation in any form. This includes, but is not limited to information or links to facilitate illegal drug use, theft, network intrusion, creation of code for malicious purposes, prohibited software copying, prohibited use of copyrighted\/patented material, so-called \"warez\", or sites which provide torrents or links to such content. Illegal content shall be removed swiftly and dealt with in full accordance with known applicable law. Spamming is forbidden. Please alert staff to the presence of spam should you encounter it. Offending spam accounts and associated IP addresses will be banned. Do not reply to spam posts as it increases the amount of work required to clean them up. Publicity, if it is related to Arch (as a project or community) or GNU\/Linux\/FOSS, will usually be allowed. Promoting web-invites, blog posts or commercial promotions are actively discouraged, or outright prohibited. Registering just to promote your issue\/cause, FOSS-related or not, treats the community as a resource and is not acceptable. Other considerations in this category include: Arch Linux distribution support ONLY Arch-based distributions have their own support fora and users of those distributions should be actively encouraged to seek support there. These distributions often use different packages, package versions, repositories, or make custom system configurations silently, practically rendering support for such projects within Arch Linux impossible. Community technical support shall only be provided for the Arch Linux distribution and the Arch User Repository. Posting issues with, and requesting support for, derivative distributions or operating systems other than Arch Linux are prohibited. Avoid controversy\/controversial topics There is no explicit list of topics considered to be \"trollish\", controversial or provocative, but in the past, posts pertaining to Religion, Sports, Race, Nationalism and Politics have invariably been closed. Therefore,  specifically avoid these and all divisive topics in the Arch community.  The staff certainly realize that such issues are deeply ingrained human realities. However, this is a technical community and is not intended nor able to effectively facilitate such commentary nor the resulting unrest. Furthermore, questioning or discussing the methods used by the Arch Linux development team will be monitored closely and locked or removed if deemed unhelpful and\/or unproductive. Specific fora guidelines In addition to the common code, each of the fora has its own specific guidelines summarized in the following subsections.

The Company is domiciled in Switzerland and all data storage infrastructure is also located solely within Switzerland, and thus governed by the laws and regulations of Switzerland.  You are free, at any given time, to opt-out of those features through the account settings panel. In order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers, ProtonMail uses a variety of human verification methods. You may be asked to verify using either reCaptcha, Email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if you are a spammer. If this data is saved permanently, it is always saved as a cryptographic hash, which ensures that the raw values cannot be deciphered by us. We also have no technical means to access your encrypted message contents. Account creation: It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an account, but you may provide an external email address for notification or password recovery purposes.  It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an account, Should you choose to provide it, we do associate another email address with your account (for password recovery, or notifications).

Account activity: Due to limitations of the SMTP protocol, we have access to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address incoming messages originated from, message subject, and message sent and received times. We do NOT have access to encrypted message content but unencrypted messages sent from external providers to ProtonMail are scanned for Spam and Viruses to pursue the legitimate interest of the protection of our users.

{"plain_text":"We don\u2019t keep your search history and we don\u2019t create an advertising profile to target you. How does Qwant protect your privacy? When you use Qwant as a search engine, we do not set any advertising cookie on your browser, nor do we look at what you personally searched for previously. When you make a query, it is immediately pseudonymized using the methods set forth in this Privacy Policy. We also undertake to make every effort to guarantee the security and confidentiality of our users\u2019 personal data and in particular to prevent such data from being altered, deleted or accessed by unauthorized third parties. The URL of Qwant begins with \u201cHTTPS\u201d, which indicates to users that they are communicating their data securely through the TLS protocol. Technically, the TLS guarantees visitors that their data cannot be intercepted while in transit over the network in a fraudulent or accidental manner. In addition, the padlock that appears in front of the Qwant URL on most browsers certifies that you are browsing a secure site. Qwant has a Privacy office dedicated to protecting your privacy. It also has a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Both work closely with eachother to ensure that the relevant regulation regarding personal data is applied as strongly as it should. The DPO keeps an updated register of all processing of personal data made by Qwant for his services. For instance, when you create an account on the site, you can choose to fill in your profile and this is a processing of personal data for which the register will say how data may be kept (and how long), and who can access it. The DPO makes this register available to anyone who asks : privacy@qwant.com We commit to do anything we can to ensure the security and confidentiality of our users personal data, including by preventing data damage, loss, or access by unauthorized third parties. Qwant\u2019s URL has the HTTPS header that shows users they communicate with Qwant through a secure channel using the TLS protocol. Technically, TLS ensures users that their data can\u2019t be intercepted by fraud. Moreover, the green lock that you see on most browsers when using Qwant certifies that you are browsing a secure website. We use your browser\u2019s \u201clocal storage\u201d technology to store your browser settings (language, enabling or disabling options) on your device. If you change these technical parameters, a cookie may be installed on your browser, exclusively for the purpose of preserving these parameters. You have the possibility to delete the \u201clocal storage\u201d data or the cookie from your browser. However, the provision of a search engine requires some data processing. In such cases, we collect some personal data such as your name, firstname and email address when you register to our services, or when you use forms available on our website. What data is processed by Qwant when you make search queries? Qwant also collects connection\u00a0data, not associated with your search queries, only to ensure the security of its information system and, if you create or modify Boards, to respect the obligation to identify content creators such as mandated by French law (article 6-II de la Loi pour la confiance en l\u2019\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique).  Even when you are connected with an ID, we don\u2019t use any cookie nor any other tracking device when you browse the site. The only technology that may be installed on your browser, called \u201clocal storage\u201d, is used to locally save your settings (language, activation or deactivation of options\u2026). In order to have knowledge of the existing contents on the Web and to offer you the most relevant results, Qwant automatically indexes Web pages on which personal data of any kind is likely to be present. Qwant retains this data until two years after the last indexing by our robots, based on our legitimate interest in having an index of publicly available content on the Web (article 6.1.f of the GDPR). A salted hash of the user\u2019s IP address with the salt that changes ever three months at the latest (i.e. the result of a mathematical formula based on this IP address, not the IP address itself); Personal data that you transmit are never disclosed or sold by Qwant to third parties, except for job applications that may be shared with recruiting\u00a0partners, unless you ask us not to. After this period, the keywords are no longer associated to an identifier and are retained for 12 months for aggregate statistical analysis (e.g. to know how many times a keyword is searched over a given period of time). This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and meets Qwant\u2019s legitimate interest (article 6.1.f of the GDPR) to secure and make its services reliable. For Qwant and Qwant Junior accounts, your data is removed 7 days after you request that the account be deleted. If you use a EDU Qwant Junior account (edu.qwantjunior.com), your data is removed 3 months after the account deletion request. During this period, you can ask that your account be reactivated using your initial username and password. For data that may be collected when you exercize some rights (access, opposition, rectification, right to be forgotten\u2026), the duration\u00a0of retention depends on what the law prescribes for each of these rights. Please refer to the next section of this Privacy Policy for details. For connection data that the information system security department may access, the\u00a0duration of retention is 6 months. For Qwant Boards, French law makes it mandatory to keep some connection data (e.g. user ID used, URL or position, nature of the operation, time\u2026) for one year. In order to provide you with relevant results from around the world when we do not have the answers to your queries by ourselves, we have partnered with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited to provide a portion of our search results and provide contextual advertising based on the keywords entered and your geographic region. For this purpose, as well as for the security and reliability of our partner\u2019s services (detection of spam, automated activity, fraudulent clicks on ads\u2026), Qwant may transfer to this partner the following pseudonymous data related to your query: \u2013 The searched keywords; \u2013 The type and version of the browser used (User Agent); \u2013 The first three bytes of your IP address; \u2013 The approximate geographical area at the origin of the search, at the scale of a region or a city; \u2013 A salted hash generated from: your IP address, your User Agent and a salt that changes at least every 3 months. This data is transferred to this partner within the European Union, and may be retained in accordance with Bing\u2019s Privacy Policy for a maximum duration of 18 months. This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and responds to the legitimate interest of Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (article 6.1.f) to make its services secure and reliable. Qwant also keeps other data related to your use of the services (associated for 7 days with a hash calculated from your IP address and the User Agent of your browser) including : \u2013 The source of the user\u2019s visit to the site (the HTTP referrer and the search field used to trigger the request); Qwant does not require you to register to use the search engine. However, you may wish to register to log in and personalize services. You are free to manage your account information (modify, correct, update and delete information). In order to manage its users\u2019 accounts and to send our newsletter (if you have chosen to subscribe), Qwant collects the following data: When you use Qwant, no personal information whatsoever is neither captured or transmitted to advertisers.

This right gives you the possibility to have your data deleted as soon as possible by Qwant. Concretely, you have the possibility to delete your account by following instructions detailed here. As of the request to close the account, the data you have provided will then be deleted after 7 days, subject to our legal and regulatory obligations.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION THIS SECTION AND THE NEXT SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.  You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.  Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. In the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute. This notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it. You must send any such notice to Discord by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.  The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.  Binding Arbitration. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California. Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state\u2019s law.  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost. Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney\u2019s fees. Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.  If Discord\u2019s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.  You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.  Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com. The notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service. If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either. If any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.  Survival. This Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California. Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state\u2019s law.  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost. Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney\u2019s fees. Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

Discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Discord customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.

{"plain_text":"Deutsch   English   Fran\u00e7ais They store a log of each http request with this data. It can be summarized as IP address and client device and a whole bunch of data on how their infrastructure is doing. From neither will we hand over individual data to anybody else and any privacy breaches we will disclose as soon as possible. We also delete, anonymize and remove data regularly.   Our software, be it the Nextcloud server or the Android or iOS apps, are designed to not sent any user data to us. The optional Usage Survey app can sent usage statistics like installed apps to us to help us improve our service. You can review and approve the data before it is sent. We store the data aggregated and not per user, so a theft of our data can not be used to get any information about any specific installation.  With regards to third party apps: we can not take any responsibility for third-party apps and the data they store or sent about users However, we do not have the ability to check all code of all third party applications and thus we recommend you are careful when installing third party apps. What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?  Like most websites, nextcloud.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  nextcloud.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information to third parties unless legally obliged to do so. We honour the do-not-track directive. nextcloud.com will not track anything if this is enabled. Furthermore, our website visit statistics tool Mamoto is configured to anonymize visitor IP addresses data by not storing the last digits of all IP addresses.  When do we collect information? The Play Store version equal to or newer than 1.5.0 for Nextcloud supports push notifications which use the Google servers. However Google does not have access to the actual notification data. Only a header with a subject is sent via Google, but in encrypted form, and the rest of the content is retrieved directly from your Nextcloud server and not sent through Google.  How do we use your information?  If you enter an email address on our site, you agree with that (otherwise we can not sent you that white paper either). We might sent follow-up emails (like a reminder if you did not download the white paper, or a notification of a new white paper), from which you can opt-out on the bottom of the emails.  In line with our business strategy of not monetizing home and small business users but aim for large enterprises, our goal is to ONLY track employees of companies using their work email. We try to drop all home\/private users from the database as soon as we find out they are private users, of course after we have sent them the white paper they asked for. For example, we remove contacts with an @gmail or @icloud address and keep obviously business related addresses (@acme @example-ltd @placeholder-corp.com). For those we then might follow up on a End-to-end Encryption white paper download a week later with an offer to download our Server-side Encryption white paper.  We do not use third-party services (like Google Analytics) that track this information on our behalf. If you disable cookies, some minor features might be disabled.  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice.
